                <p>Young Entrepreneur’s Programme, a “commercial venture” was conducted by classes 6th and 7th on Saturday 14th December 2019 in the school premises. The project was funded with limited seed money given the by the students themselves. Handcrafted wares, accessories as well as sweetmeats and savories were displayed in the colorful stalls which added to the vibrancy of brisk “buying and selling” .

                    The objective was to strategies, manage finances and make a profit. The proceeds were then handed over to an NGO – thus the value of philanthropy was inculcated in all.</p>

                <p>“Art provides an opportunity for kaleidoscopic thinking. Each time we shift the lens of our perceptions, we gain new perspectives — and new opportunities for innovation.”— Linda Naiman

                    We at National Public School, Kalkere very ardently believe that art education helps unfold a child’s potential. Our students not only very enthusiastically await their art class but also lose no opportunity to fulfill their artistic endeavour. It is widely believed that art caters to the multiple intelligence in all of us; and is also the food that nurtures our spirit and heals our soul.</p>

NPS Kalkere provides students with many activities and varied opportunities to develop new skills and experiences beyond academics. NPS is constantly striving to add to the variety of experiences and activities offered to the students. NPS also encourage students to take initiative and add to the list of co-scholastic activities offered in school.

                    ARTS
                    Arts education refers to education in the disciplines of music, dance, theatre, and visual arts. The Arts are a key component in improving learning throughout all academic areas. Studies show that the Arts develop neural systems that benefit fine motor skills, creativity and improved emotional balance.

                    A student who expands his artistic sensibility sees the world from a different perspective. According to research, the thinking skills used in making visual art such as experimentation, exploration and imagination become the foundation for higher-level thinking skills such as synthesis, inquiry and research.

                    Artistic pursuits produce thinking patterns and abilities that transfer to other areas of life. NPS Arts teachers aim to advance student creativity, visual communication skills, artistic technique, and aesthetic sensibility.

                    PHYSICAL EDUCATION
                    PE is an integral part of the school programme at NPS. It gives students the opportunity to build motor skills, coordination, movement, and learn important life lessons such as discipline, persistence, patience, teamwork and cooperation, and stress-management skills.

                    Physical activity and fitness is known to benefit both health and academic performance, directly impacting the behavior and development of the brain. From a social standpoint, sports create a sense of community and give students a chance to form closer relationships with their peers.

                    At NPS, students can choose from a wide variety of sports and physical activity like football, throw-ball, volleyball, basketball, badminton, tennis, table tennis, cricket, yoga, aerobics and athletics.

                    LIFE SKILLS EDUCATION
                    NPS includes a Life Skills programme as a part of the curriculum. Adolescence is characterized by rapid physiological and psychological changes. As a part of the programme, students learn tools to manage their emotions, become more self-aware, communicate effectively and manage interpersonal relationships. .

                    NEWSPAPER IN EDUCATION (NIE)
                    Organized by the Times of India to increase general knowledge and social awareness in children, this programme is lively and enlightening.</p>
